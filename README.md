**ABOUT THE PROJECT**  

A virtual reality game in which a player swims/dives in an underwater environment with the goal of identifying a set number/type of fish or other objects. With each fish/object the player identifies, their score increases by a certain amount of points or they gain achievements/awards. The virtual environment will include various common fish and plants as well as nearly extinct fish and plants.
Our game will impact social good in a few different ways. For one, it provides the opportunity for people who can not snorkel/dive in the ocean, for various reasons such as disabilities, location and or mental issues/fear, to experience this unique activity via virtual reality. Also by integrating nearly extinct species, our project encourages users to look more closely at how they as individuals may be impacting the health and wellbeing of the oceans and in particular of other coexisting living organisms. Overall, our project will educate users and expand on previous understandings about just how diverse, complex and beautiful life on Earth is. In order to achieve this impact, elements of the virtual world including sounds and visuals must mirror that of being underwater in the real world. This includes movement of the body, as we naturally move slower underwater, and movement of sound, as sound travels faster through water. We also need to make sure that we accurately depict all the living organisms as there is an education aspect to the project as well.

**FUTURE UPDATES**  

More sensory experiences to come, for example we plan on using a candle to reproduce the scent of the ocean for users.

**Project Milestone 3**

We implemented two navagation techniques. One uses the joystick to move around in the scene. The other uses the pull and grab technique with the controllers to make it seem as if you are moving your arms and swiming underwater. For the wayfinding technique, we added two signs into the scene to help the player understand what game is and to give the player a visual fish index so that they know what they are looking for. For the manipulation technique, we used colliders to check if the player comes near a fish, which then checks if it is the correct fish they are looking for and if so, increases the number of fish found by 1.

User Experience Feedback:
    -Does the movement system feel intuitive?
    Both users enjoyed the movement experience, though one commented that it was rather difficult to find how to move up or down, as the joysticks did not provide that movement. When the locomotion system was changed to swinging arms to move, one commented that they felt more immersed in the experience, like she was actually swimming, while the other believes that it took away from the visuals of the game as it was harder to figure out the controls, and it was harder to move precisely.
    
    -*Are you able to understand your objective based on the information given to you on the screen?*
    Both users were able to figure out what their objective was, however it was difficult without instruction for either to figure out which fish they were going after.

    -*Would you prefer to have a note on the interface telling you how far you are from the fish you are looking for?*
    Both users agreed that it would be helpful to have an interface feature to determine where the fish you were looking for was.

    -*Any general feedback?*
    One user commented that she would like to see a better method of selection when getting near the fish, as it was unclear whether the user actually reached the fish or not. The other user believes the play area should be smaller, as it was very hard to find the first fish, much less the others.
