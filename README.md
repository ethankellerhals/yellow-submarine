**ABOUT THE PROJECT**  

A virtual reality game in which a player swims/dives in an underwater environment with the goal of identifying a set number/type of fish or other objects. With each fish/object the player identifies, their score increases by a certain amount of points or they gain achievements/awards. The virtual environment will include various common fish and plants as well as nearly extinct fish and plants.
Our game will impact social good in a few different ways. For one, it provides the opportunity for people who can not snorkel/dive in the ocean, for various reasons such as disabilities, location and or mental issues/fear, to experience this unique activity via virtual reality. Also by integrating nearly extinct species, our project encourages users to look more closely at how they as individuals may be impacting the health and wellbeing of the oceans and in particular of other coexisting living organisms. Overall, our project will educate users and expand on previous understandings about just how diverse, complex and beautiful life on Earth is. In order to achieve this impact, elements of the virtual world including sounds and visuals must mirror that of being underwater in the real world. This includes movement of the body, as we naturally move slower underwater, and movement of sound, as sound travels faster through water. We also need to make sure that we accurately depict all the living organisms as there is an education aspect to the project as well.

**FUTURE UPDATES**  

More sensory experiences to come, for example we plan on using a candle to reproduce the scent of the ocean for users.
